## [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Codsoft/blob/main/Rock_Paper_Scissors.ipynb)

Welcome to the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This Program contains a simple, interactive command-line implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python.
### Program Description
1. Displays the game name and rules.
2. Prompt the user to start the game.
3. The user selects rock, paper, or scissors.
4. The computer makes a random choice.

## [Password Generator Program](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Codsoft/blob/main/Password_generator.ipynb)

Welcome to the Password Generator Program. This Program contains a simple, interactive command-line implementation of a password generator using Python.
### Program Description
1. Displays a welcome message and instructions.
2. Provides menu options to generate a password or exit the program.
3. Prompts the user to enter the desired password length (5 to 16 characters).
4. Generates passwords based on length:
5. Weak (5-8 characters): Numbers only.
6. Better (9-12 characters): Lowercase letters and numbers.
7. Strong (13-16 characters): Special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers.
8. Displays the generated password.
9. Allows the user to generate another password or exit.

## [Simple Calculator (Basic Arithmetic operations)](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Codsoft/blob/main/Calaculator__(Basic_Arithmetic_Operator).ipynb)

Welcome to the Basic Arithmetic Operations Program. This Program contains a simple, interactive command-line implementation for performing basic arithmetic operations using Python.
### Program Description
1. Displays a welcome message and menu options.
2. Prompts the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo.
3. Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
4. Performs the chosen arithmetic operation and displays the result (handles division by zero error also).
5. Allows the user to perform another operation or exit the program.
6. The program ends when the user chooses to exit.

## [To-Do List Application](https://github.com/anuragchakravarty/Codsoft/blob/main/To_Do_List.ipynb)
Welcome to the To-Do List Application. This program allows you to manage your tasks interactively via the command line.
###Program Description:
1. Displays a welcome message and menu options.
2. Prompts users to add, view, or remove tasks from the list.
3. Handles task removal by task number, including error handling for invalid inputs.
4. Allows users to perform multiple operations until they choose to exit.
5. Ends the program when the user opts to exit.
